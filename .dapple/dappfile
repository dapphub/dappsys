# Change these to your package's name and version.

name: 'mypackage'
version: '0.0.1a'

# A mapping of required Dapple packages to the particular
# versions this package needs.
#
dependencies:
    core: 'latest'

# All paths in the dappfile and in your local Solidity
# imports are interpreted relative to this directory.
# By default set to the project's root directory.
# The line below would make it relative to the
# "contracts" directory in the project's root.
#
# source_dir: 'contracts'

# A list of files to ignore, relative to "source_dir."
#
# ignore:
#     - ignored_file.sol

# A map of preprocessor variable names to values to
# pass on to your preprocessor. For example, the
# default preprocessor is cogapp: this mapping gets
# passed to `cog.options.defines`. Other preprocessor
# plugins should treat this map in a similar manner.
# 
# preprocessor_vars:
#     my_template_var: 'my value'

# A list of addresses to swap in during preprocessing.
# To reference a Dapple constant, put something like
# this in your source code: CONSTANT:"my_constant"
# For example, if you had a NameReg constant defined:
# address nameReg = CONSTANT:"NameReg"
#
# Any constants referenced in your source code but
# left undefined will be placed in your binary output
# in the form __CONSTANT:"my_constant"__, in order to
# prevent accidental deployment with unbound constants.
#
# This also allows deploy scripts to swap in addresses
# that had been, prior to the beginning of the deploy
# script, left unbound.
#
# constants:
#     SomeContractAddress: '0x0'

# Constant override values based on the context
# name passed to dapple. For example,
# `dapple build production` would grab the constants
# defined in the "production" map below and use those
# to override the constants defined above, and to
# define any constants that'd been left undefined.
#
# contexts:
#     production:
#         SomeContractAddress: '0x1'
